					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned the importance of making color accessible for people with visual impairments and color vision deficiencies. The purpose of the design is to enable every user to obtain a digital interactive experience, including, of course, visually impaired people. I also learned how to make color accessible, not only by changing the color but also by using other methods.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part is the legal interpretation of accessibility. It shows that the website’s design rationality and accessibility are confirmed from a moral and legal point of view. This part is directly explained in the document’s content.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>Color accessibility enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as their non-visually-impaired counterparts. In 2017, The World Health Organization estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment. That statistic alone is reason enough to design for accessibility.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>8. The content of this web page is very logical. It explains the concept, the reasons, and how to implement it. Every part is very clear. The typesetting is simple, with the headline and the text content, which is easy to read.</p>
