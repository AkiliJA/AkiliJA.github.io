                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>A recurring theme throughout all the UI's are dynamic, lively animations that engages the user. I didn't know that we have freedom to this extent for customizing these things. It definetely also made me feel like each app/site was like a game, and that tweaks in just the UI can make a significant difference in user sastisfaction.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>Didn't specifically have a favorite part per se, but I thought that the general inspirations to be drawn from here are very interesting. Many moving parts without excessive clutter or mechanics can really improve the user experience. And the best part is that they don't have to be complicated - definetely feeling inspired after this!</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>I really liked the interface for the AI Powered Assistant. It looks super futuristic and feels really sleek. Not only is the graphical design exquisite, again the dynamic animataions and transitions make the experience much more engaging. The entire palette and rich movements makes it feel like there really is a cool person that's pointing you where to go. Also really liked the cryptocurrency transaction animation - it really nicely tackles the age old issue of waiting with a nice twist - the vibrating rings along with a progress bar makes the wait seem more fun as time is progressing, and is just generally fun to look at.</p>
