					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>White space is especially important for designers. White space can maintain forces and attract readers' attention to the emphasized things. White space can also reduce visual noise and improve visual organization and readability. It gives the user's reading interface a good experience and obtains information faster, easier, and more comprehensively.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Some people may think that white space is useless. But my favorite part about the article is the necessity of using white space. To enable users to harvest more information on one page, folding (the appearance of white space) is necessary. This can prevent readers from giving up reading or missing important information because the page is too long.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>Think of white space as a breath of fresh air. Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe. Yes, this may sound corny. But I stand by this.</p>
