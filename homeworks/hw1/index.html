        <p>Hi! My name is Akili Wu, and I'm an international student. I like dancing very much, especially Kpop dance, but part of my time will be spent studying, resting and, most importantly, playing games in the library. Recently, I have been playing Stardew Valley with my friends. I am pleased to meet you guys in WDD's class.</p>

            <li>The perspective of this article is that I may have thought of it but have never really used it. Analyzing other apps is the best way to learn design. Breaking down the app is also very practical. By analyzing each part's design structure and purpose, we understand the creative of app design from a better perspective and inspire my design.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article is the analysis of the search bar. Writing "Try London" in the search bar can attract users to use the search bar and provide users with search ideas. This design point is frequent but very ingenious.</li>
            <li>You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product. Open an app you use often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content. Instead, I want you to actively focus on the screen in front of you.</li>
